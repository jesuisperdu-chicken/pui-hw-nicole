        "bagHistory": "Though all of the major fashion houses have designed countless elegant styles that \
         have stood the test of time, we would be remiss if we did not include two from Hermès.  \
         While the Kelly was the first bag to rise to such fame in the house, it was eventually followed by the Birkin almost 100 years later. \
         As the story goes, Jane Birkin was seated next to Hermès Chief Executive Jean-Louis Dumas on an airplane in \
         the early 1980s, expressing her need for a chic carryall handbag. The aptly named Birkin bag was born in 1984, inspired by both Birkin as well as their existing Haut à Courroies bag from the early 1900s. The waiting list for this style is no joke, mainly due to the fact that it takes at least two full days to craft a single bag.",

        "BagPopCultureRef": "The Birkin has been seen in films and television shows such as The Royal Tennenbaums, Blue Jasmine. Sex and the City and more. It’s also a celebrity favorite, having been worn by Victoria Beckham, J. Lo, the Hiltons, the Kardashians, Lady Gaga etc",

        "bagHistory": "This classic Chanel is actually Karl Lagerfeld’s 1983 re-interpretation of the brand’s 2.55 handbag, which was created by \
        Gabrielle Chanel back in 1955. Known to many as the Chanel Classic Flap, the name of the purse is actually the style code that the original \
        version was given (A01112). Today, the bag comes in many different colors and sizes, all of them boasting the double C clasp and interlaced \
        leather features on a metal chain strap that Lagerfeld catapulted to fame. So popular and sought-after is the product that it retains its value \
        among vintage circles as well.",

        compendium of celebrities and their beloved Chanel bags, and that’s probably what’s most notable about the finished product. \
        It takes quite the iconic bag to look at home on the shoulders of such a diverse cast of characters, and Chanel’s signature \
        pieces look lovely on all (well, almost all) of the women below.",

        "bagHistory": "You might know it as the “motorcycle city bag,” but this Balenciaga entry is actually officially named \
        Classic City. A bit of history regarding it: the brand’s chief designer at the time, Nicholas Ghesquière, created \
        the piece back in 2001 to the dismay of management. Thinking it too soft and lacking in structure, the company decided to indulge\
         the designer and only create 25 prototypes to be used on the runway and given out to celebrities. Clearly, Ghesquière knew what he was doing.\
          Instantly becoming a must-have, the edgy (but feminine) bag caught the attention of model Kate Moss during a fitting. She requested one and immediately started wearing it around town." ,
        "imageFile2": "the rest of the pop culture images/bal city left.png",
        "BagPopCultureRef":"In a 2011 WWD interview, Nicholas responded to why the bag is so successful: “No logo. Very light. Very effective. \
        There is something familiar with the vintage side. Women and girls thought it was something they'd always have. It was a new, fresh thing, \
        but it looked like an old, good, friendly thing.”" ,

        the current model (Kelly II) actually comes in two different styles, one rigid and the other softer. Each bag sold by\
         the brand is created by a single artisan and requires between 18 and 25 hours of handicraft.",

        commonly seen on the arms of celebrities including Victoria Beckham (who has a collection of over 100 Birkin bags!), Kim Kardashian, Sophia Bush,\
         Emma Watson, Miranda Kerr, Katy Perry, and more. Many women who have become successful models, actresses, singers, or television personalities have shown \
         off their rise to fame with an iconic Birkin or Kelly bag." ,

         long-time Gucci lovers rejoiced: the Gucci Jackie was back. The Jackie bag was originally \
         created in 1961 and from its inception it has been a staple for the house, reimagined over the decades in different \
         sizes and iterations. The bag received its name after Jackie Kennedy was spotted carrying it on countless occasions. From its inception, \
         the Jackie bag embodied the jetsetter of the time and was spotted on fashion muses, nobility, and actresses alike.",
        "imageFile2": "the rest of the pop culture images/jackie right.png",
        "BagPopCultureRef": "The signature curved half-moon shape and signature hardware defines the bag and this iteration is \
        very similar to the first from 1961. Because of this, Creative Director Alessandro Michele named this bag the Gucci Jackie \
        1961. Available for men and women in a diverse range of colors, sizes, and designs which allows for versatile wear, the Jackie \
        is one of the most anticipated releases for Fall 2020. Alessandro Michele sourced a vintage Jackie bag from his very own archive and set out to make it relevant \
        for today’s wearer with a contemporary twist. This meant offering new sizes (mini, small and medium) as well as a removable and adjustable strap. Michele replicated \
        the strap from his own vintage piece, which allows the Jackie to meld and change to the wearer and occasion at that moment. In addition to the half moon shape,\
         the piston closure is equally as recognizable and important to the design. " ,

        the brand’s most iconic bags of all time, The Lady Dior has been a favorite for stars since it was first seen on the arm of Diana Princess of Wales in 1995. At \
        the time this Dior bag did not have a name, but because of this historic moment in handbag history, it received the perfect one: the Lady Dior. Since the bag was born it\
         has become, and remains, a beloved choice of everyday handbag lovers and celebs alike. It can be dressed up or down, and ties together any look." ,

        "bagHistory": "The lock on the Reissue is the original lock, it is called the Mademoiselle Lock as Ms Coco Chanel never married, the ‘CC’ lock was introduced to \
        the Classic Flap Bags only in the 1980s by designer Karl Lagerfeld. The 2.55 in its name refers to the first release of the 2.55 bag in February of 1955. Coco Chanel \
        grew up in an orphanage/convent, therefore, the double chain shoulder strap comes from when the children’s’ caretakers in the orphanage would dangle keys from their waists \
        with the same type of chains as on the Reissue. Also, the zippered compartment on the inside of the front flap of the Reissue is where Coco sequestered her love letters, \
        as she was having an affair at that time. The brownish red color of the inside represents the color of Coco and the rest of the children’s uniforms \
        (the nuns’ were black with white trim: thus, the packaging on Chanel Parfum/Eau de Parfum/Eau de Toilette). The back outside flap of the Reissue actually marks where Coco would stash extra money!",

        "BagPopCultureRef": "In February 2005, Karl Lagerfeld re-made the 2.55 – exactly as Coco Chanel had made in 1955, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the 2.55. \
        It came to be known as the Reissue. Technically the term Reissue should only be used for the bags that were made to commemorate the original – so only those in 2005.\
         However, it has become convenient to call all 2.55s that resemble the original 2.55 Reissues and all 2.55s that have the interlocking CCs Classic Flaps.",

        "bagHistory": "The most iconic aspect of the Speedy? The brand’s Monogram print, which is as defining of Louis Vuitton as its bag structures are. \
        Fun fact: the purse was dubbed L’Express when it first launched and it was available in three different sizes (30 centimeters, 35 centimeters and 40 centimeters).\
         In the 1950s, the one and only Audrey Hepburn asked for a more compact style of the product, a request that led to the creation of the Speedy 25.",

        "BagPopCultureRef": "Grace Kelly may have been a fan of Hermes, but Audrey Hepburn was continually photographed wearing her favorite Louis Vuitton Speedy.\
         Some people may say that the bag is played out, but don’t let people who chase labels dissuade you from enjoying a bag that has an important historical place \
         in the lineage of the luxury handbag. With all of the different size and design permutations, there’s a Speedy out there to suit every style. Fun fact, the flower \
         in the loading gif is an iconic Takashi Murakami icon. He collaborated several times with Louis Vuitton; some examples include the multicolor logo, the cherries illustration\

             Edoardo Fendi) in 1997, the Fendi Baguette bag has evolved over 25 years to become the it-bag for the ages. The unique design is an ode to the Parisian lady. \
             It was inspired by the blasé way in which French women would carry a baton-esque loaf of bread under their arms and was designed to sit comfortably over the wearer’s shoulder to mimic this." ,

        "BagPopCultureRef": "During the 2000s, logomania was an omnipresent obsession, and the bag’s iconic inverted FF hardware (and recognisability) meant it was an instantaneous status symbol. \
        Alas, given the overwhelming hype around it, knock-off versions quickly began to emerge in high-street retailers and bootleg designer stores. Accordingly, excitement eventually waned and the brand actually even \
        briefly discontinued their once-expansive range of Baguettes. This bag shot to it-bag status during the early 2000's when Carrie's bag in Sex and the City was stolen from her.",
