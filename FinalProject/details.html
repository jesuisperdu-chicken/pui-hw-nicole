          <p>
          Though all of the major fashion houses have designed countless elegant styles that have stood the test of time, we would be remiss if we did not include two from Hermès. 
          While the Kelly was the first bag to rise to such fame in the house, it was eventually followed by the Birkin almost 100 years later. 
          As the story goes, Jane Birkin was seated next to Hermès Chief Executive Jean-Louis Dumas on an airplane in the early 1980s, expressing her need for a chic carryall handbag. 
          The aptly named Birkin bag was born in 1984, inspired by both Birkin as well as their existing Haut à Courroies bag from the early 1900s. 
          The waiting list for this style is no joke, mainly due to the fact that it takes at least two full days to craft a single bag.
